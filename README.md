Task Management System
Objective
Develop a scalable and maintainable full-stack Task Management System with advanced features to test the candidate's ability to:

Build a scalable and maintainable full-stack application.

Integrate multiple technologies seamlessly.

Optimize for performance, usability, and security.

Project Requirements
Frontend (ReactJS)
Core Features:

User authentication (Login/Signup pages).

Dashboard to display a user's tasks with filtering (e.g., by status, due date).

Task creation, editing, and deletion forms with validation.

Responsive design compatible with mobile and desktop.

Add dark mode support.

RESTful APIs for authentication and CRUD operations.

Basic error handling and structured response format.

Enhancements:

Integrate caching (e.g., Redis) to improve API response times.

Implement unit and integration testing for critical APIs.

Design APIs to handle bulk task updates (e.g., batch editing).

Add a task activity log (track actions like creation, updates, and deletions).

Backend (Node.js with Express)
Core Features:

RESTful APIs for authentication and CRUD operations.

Basic error handling and structured response format.

Enhancements:

Integrate caching (e.g., Redis) to improve API response times.

Implement unit and integration testing for critical APIs.

Design APIs to handle bulk task updates (e.g., batch editing).

Add a task activity log (track actions like creation, updates, and deletions).

Database (MySQL)
Core Structure:

Tables: Users, Tasks, Roles, Task Activities.

Relationships:

Users ↔ Tasks: One-to-Many.

Tasks ↔ Task Activities: One-to-Many.

Users ↔ Roles: Many-to-Many.

Enhancements:

Add indexing for frequently queried columns (e.g., User_ID, Status).

Use stored procedures for complex queries (e.g., generating task reports).

Implement soft deletes using a Deleted_at column.

Additional Features
Performance Optimizations:
Apply lazy loading for tasks on the frontend.

Use database query optimization techniques (e.g., eager loading with Laravel or JOINs in SQL).

Security Enhancements:
Sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection.

Implement HTTPS with CSRF tokens.

Secure sensitive information using environment variables (e.g., API keys).

Analytics and Reporting (Bonus):
Generate a summary report of tasks (e.g., total tasks, completed, overdue).

Evaluation Criteria
Code Quality:

Clean, modular, and DRY code.

Well-commented and formatted.

Functionality:

Fulfillment of core and advanced features.

Minimal bugs and glitches.

UI/UX Design:

Intuitive and visually appealing interface.

Responsive across devices.

Database Design:

Efficient structure and normalization.

Indexing and relationship management.

Security:

Proper handling of sensitive data.

Protection against common vulnerabilities.

Performance Optimization:

Use of caching and efficient algorithms.

Quick API responses under load.

Documentation:

Detailed README file with setup instructions.
